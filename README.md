## This is repository containing the presentation for PyData Southampton lightning talk on the 16th Jan 2024 and code to replicate results. 

The talk is on optimising your journey for a satisfyingly speedier commute. This uses the google maps Routes API for a car journey. Other modes of transport are available. The routes documentation can be found here (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes). Example code is in the template code file.

You will need to set up your own google dev account for the free 90 day trial and set up billing. Don't worry, you are given ~£235 in free credit, you won't use all of this up. The rate applied depends upon your api request but is either £5/1000 calls, £10/1000 calls or £15/1000 calls. 

You can then get your own api-key, input the api key into the api-key variable. Then add your own route and you are set. You can check the route given by the api by taking the polyline output string and enter that into google's polyline decoder tool on the web. 

Happy commuting !
